C++ Assignments | Bubble Sorting | Week 9
 1q)Which of the following(s) is/are true about bubble sort:
  1)It is stable sort
 2)It has a worst case space complexity of O(n)
 3)It involves swapping of adjacent elements
 4)After each iteration, the greatest element is placed at the end of the array
ANS) 1,3,4
bubble sort is a stable sort and it involves swapping of adjacent elements. By each pass the last position have the largest number
best case :- O(n)
average case :-O(n^2)
worst case :- O(n^2)



2Q) What will the following array look like after one iteration of bubble sort [1,6,2,5,4,3].
1) [1,3,2,4,5,6]
 2)[1,2,3,4,5,6]
 3)[1,2,5,4,3,6]
 4)[1,2,4,5,3,6]
by 1st pass the array becomes [1,2,5,4,3,6]
[1,6,2,5,4,3]
[1,6,2,5,4,3]
[1,2,6,5,4,3]
[1,2,5,6,4,3]
[1,2,5,4,6,3]
[1,2,5,4,3,6]





3) In which case does bubble sort works in the most efficient way:
 1)When the array is sorted in increasing order
 2)When the array is sorted partially
 3)When the array is sorted in decreasing order.
 4) When the array is nearly sorted
ans) when the array is sorted partially bubble sort works in the most efficient way


4q)Sort the array in descending order using Bubble Sort

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[]={1,2,3,4,6,5};
    int n = 6;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
    }
    for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
        for(int j=0;j<n-1-i;j++){
            if(arr[j]<arr[j+1]) 
            swap(arr[j+1],arr[j]);
        }
    }
    cout<<endl;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
    }

    return 0;
}


5Q)Check if the given array is almost sorted. (elements are at-most one position away)
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int arr[]={1,2,64,4};
    int n=4;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        cout<<arr[i];
    }
    for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
        if(arr[i]>arr[i+1]){
            swap(arr[i],arr[i+1]);
            i++;
        }
    }
    int i;
    for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++)
        if(arr[i]>arr[i+1]){
            cout<<"No\n";
            break;
        }
        if(i==n-1) cout<<"yes"<<endl;
    
}
